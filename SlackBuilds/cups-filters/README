cups-filter contains backends, filters, and other software that was once
part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer maintained by Apple Inc.

In addition it contains additional filters developed independently of Apple,
especially filters for the PDF-centric printing workflow introduced by
OpenPrinting.

This package should be used with CUPS 1.6.x onwards, not with CUPS 1.5.x

This requires qpdf

Optional dependency: avahi
