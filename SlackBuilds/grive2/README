The purpose of this project is to provide an independent open source 
implementation of Google Drive client for GNU/Linux. It uses the 
Google Document List API to talk to the servers in Google.

This is the fork of original "Grive" (https://github.com/Grive/grive)
Google Drive client with the support for the new Drive REST API and
partial sync.

This requires json-c

Note:
- grive will not detect Google Docs formats, only stored files (DOC, PDF, JPG, etc)
- there are no realtime monitoring for now, so manual operation must be performed 
  to enable sync (can be combined with crontab)
