The ConnMan project provides a daemon for managing internet 
connections within embedded devices running the Linux OS.

Connection Manager is designed to be slim and to use as few resources 
as possible, so it can be easily integrated. It is a fully modular 
system that can be extended through plug-ins.

You must give execute permission on /etc/rc.d/rc.connmand and run
/etc/rc.d/rc.connmand start before you can use this application

To make this process repeated on every boot sequence, add this line 
in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.connmand ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.connmand start
fi
